<div id="Qiaochu-Ma" style="display:none;">
Scalar curvature encodes the volume information of small geodesic balls within a Riemannian manifold, making it, to some extent, the weakest curvature invariant. This raises a natural question: what topological constraints does scalar curvature impose on manifolds? In this talk, we shall show that for a manifold with a scalar curvature lower bound, the simplicial norm of certain characteristic classes can be controlled by its volume and isoperimetric constant. This is joint work with Guoliang Yu.

We introduce twisted coarse Baum–Connes conjecture with stable coarse algebras, a geometric analogue of the Baum–Connes conjecture with coefficients. We show that this twisted version has stronger permanence properties than the classical coarse Baum–Connes conjecture, particularly with respect to unions and subspaces. We apply this framework to relatively hyperbolic groups. For a finitely generated group $G$ that is hyperbolic relative to  $\{H_1,\cdots,H_n\}$, it is known that $G$ satisfies coarse Baum-Connes conjecture if each $H_i$ does and $H_i$ admits finite-dimensional simplicial model of the universal space proper actions. Using our permanence results, we can show that $G$ satisfies twisted coarse Baum-Connes conjecture with stable coefficients, if and only if each $H_i$ does. This is a joint work with Jintao Deng.

I will discuss obstructions to metrics of positive scalar curvature with uniformly Euclidean point singularities. This provides counterexamples to a conjecture by Schoen. I will also discuss the existence of metrics with uniformly Euclidean point singularities which cannot be smoothed by a geometric flow while preserving nonnegativity of the scalar curvature. This is based on joint work with Georg Frenck and Rudi Zeidler.

Historically the elliptic differential operators have held a special place for their importance in mathematical physics as well as their ability to connect various subjects within pure mathematics. In recent years, the Fourier theoretic approach to elliptic operators has seen much progress in its extension to a wider class of operators, those which are hypoelliptic. In this talk we will use the extended Fourier theoretic approach to provide a construction of a new hypoelliptic operator on the Heisenberg group and discuss its properties and generalizations to contact manifolds. This is joint work with Andres Franco Valiente.

Poincar&#233;–Einstein metrics play an important role in geometric analysis and mathematical physics, yet constructing new examples beyond the perturbative regime is difficult. In this talk, I will describe a class of four-dimensional Poincar&#233;–Einstein manifolds that are conformal to K&auml;hler metrics. These metrics admit a natural symmetry generated by a Killing field, which reduces the Einstein equations to a Toda-type system. This approach leads to existence and uniqueness results in the case of complex line bundles over surfaces of genus at least one. The construction produces large-scale, infinite-dimensional families of new Poincar&#233;–Einstein metrics with conformal infinities of non-positive Yamabe type. This is joint work with Mingyang Li.
